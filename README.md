Mathematical models pertaining to my research in optical neuromorphic computing

File descriptions:

  snn_signal.py: script I was using to examine the signal behaviors in an ideal spiking neural network. used to gain an intuition for how snn's relate to constant value neural networks, and how similarly or differently we need to think about them.
