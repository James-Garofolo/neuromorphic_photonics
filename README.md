Mathematical models pertaining to my research in optical neuromorphic computing

File descriptions:

* snn_signal.py: script I was using to examine the signal behaviors in an ideal spiking neural network. used to gain an intuition for how snn's relate to constant value neural networks, and how similarly or differently we need to think about them.

* circuit_function.py: script used to illustrate the ideal function of my current saving circuit. This device time-averages incoming currents from a photodetector using a capacitor to ground, and saves them as a voltage to be output using a voltage-current converting circuit. (will add a diagram when I get the time)
