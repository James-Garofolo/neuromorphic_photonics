Collection of relevant figure folders for Optical Neuromorphics research

Folder descriptions:

* snn_signal: time series plots of spiking neural network signals, used to gain an intuition for how spiking networks operate and how similar they are to constant value neural networks

* circuit_diagrams: schematics, usually made in DrawIO, for different circuits I've designed and/or am using in my design

* current_repeater_signals: simulated time series plots for signals in my current repeater circuit
